An LR(1) Parser Generator written in Python

*bcup:* Supporting your grammars since last night

## Stuff
There is some cool stuff in here. To run, go to root dir of project and enter
`python test/test_grammars.py` or `python test/test_mp.py`. Both of these are
just drivers right now, loading grammars from `grammar.notcup` and
`p4grammar.notcup` anti-respectively.
